      <p class="style2">Link to the <a href="http://www.radpath.org/index.cfm?pid=course" target="_blank">AFIP course information</a>. Look for a link to "<a href="http://www.radpath.org/inc/course/preparation.pdf" target="_blank">case preparation</a>." Read and print this document.<br>
      </p>
      <p class="style2">1.
Identify a case you want to take. This could be from your saved
worklist or from another resident's suggestion. Check out cases that
other residents have suggested <a href="http://www.jotform.com/grid/73020344120">here</a>.
What they want is really good path imaging correlation, not necessarily
a wierdo case. They also have suggestions of what they are looking for
(by organ system) in the <a href="http://www.radpath.org/inc/course/preparation.pdf" target="_blank">case preparation</a> document. <br>
  2. Look to see if there are gross path images on the Stentor timeline. If so, you have 2/3 of the images!</p>
      <h3>Get the path slides:</h3>
      <p class="style2">3.
Before you do anything with the images, call the pathology department
(7-3720) to see if they have tissue and ask them politely to prepare
slides of the tissue. If you didn't see gross path on the timeline, ask
them about if they have gross path images (if they don't, start over at
Step #1).<br>
  4. Arrange a time to pick them up.
    </p>
      <h3>Get the DICOM images:</h3>
      <span class="style2">5.
Call/email Stentor support (2-HELP/pager 5265)) to tell them that you
need DICOM images for AFIP and ask who you need to send the case
information to .<br>
6. Email this person the MRN and Accession number(s) of the case you need.<br>
7. Arrange to pick up, or sent through interoffice mail to the department.
      </span>
      <h3>Get the gross path images:</h3>
      <span class="style2">8. Go back to the gross path images in Stentor.<br>
9. Right click on the image and select 'Save/Image to file'.<br>
10. Save as type "TIFF"<br>
11. Save it to your jump drive<br>
12. Repeat process for any other images.<br>
13. Burn a CD-ROM with these images.
<br> 14. Fill out the case report information on the AFIP case
preparation instructions (you will need to look through MARS to get the
reports).<br>
  15. Print Path, Operative, and Radiology Reports from MARS. Make sure they are appropriately deidentified.
